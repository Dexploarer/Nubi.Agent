# Contributing to NUBI Agent

We love your input! We want to make contributing to NUBI Agent as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add tests for new features
- Document your code

## Testing

```bash
npm test        # Run all tests
npm run lint    # Check code style
npm run format  # Auto-format code
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the docs/ with any new documentation
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer
